Unfortunately, for many starting out in NLP and even for some experienced practicioners, the theory and practical application of these powerful models is still not well understood.\n"

BERT is a method of pretraining language representations that was used to create models that NLP practicioners can then download and use for free. You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce state of the art predictions.\n",

Why do this rather than train a train a specific deep learning model (a CNN, BiLSTM, etc.) that is well suited for the specific NLP task you need? \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quicker Development**\n",
        "\n",
        "    * First, the pre-trained BERT model weights already encode a lot of information about our language. As a result, it takes much less time to train our fine-tuned model - it is as if we have already trained the bottom layers of our network extensively and only need to gently tune them while using their output as features for our classification task. In fact, the authors recommend only 2-4 epochs of training for fine-tuning BERT on a specific NLP task (compared to the hundreds of GPU hours needed to train the original BERT model or a LSTM from scratch!). \n",

        "    * In addition and perhaps just as important, because of the pre-trained weights this method allows us to fine-tune our task on a much smaller dataset than would be required in a model that is built from scratch. A major drawback of NLP models built from scratch is that we often need a prohibitively large dataset in order to train our network to reasonable accuracy, meaning a lot of time and energy had to be put into dataset creation. By fine-tuning BERT, we are now able to get away with training a model to good performance on a much smaller amount of training data.\n",

        "This shift to transfer learning parallels the same shift that took place in computer vision a few years ago. Creating a good deep learning network for computer vision tasks can take millions of parameters and be very expensive to train. Researchers discovered that deep networks learn hierarchical feature representations (simple features like edges at the lowest layers with gradually more complex features at higher layers). Rather than training a new network from scratch each time, the lower layers of a trained network with generalized image features could be copied and transfered for use in another network with a different task. It soon became common practice to download a pre-trained deep network and quickly retrain it for the new task or add additional layers on top - vastly preferable to the expensive process of training a network from scratch. For many, the introduction of deep pre-trained language models in 2018 (ELMO, BERT, ULMFIT, Open-GPT, etc.) signals the same shift to transfer learning in NLP that computer vision saw.\n",

        "**Version 4** - *Feb 2nd, 2020* - (current)\n",
        "* Updated all calls to `model` (fine-tuning and evaluation) to use the [`SequenceClassifierOutput`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput) class.\n",
        "* Moved illustration images to Google Drive--Colab appears to no longer support images at external URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Version 3** - *Mar 18th, 2020*\n",
        "* Simplified the tokenization and input formatting (for both training and test) by leveraging the `tokenizer.encode_plus` function. \n",
        "`encode_plus` handles padding *and* creates the attention masks for us.\n",
        "* Improved explanation of attention masks.\n",
        "* Switched to using `torch.utils.data.random_split` for creating the training-validation split.\n",
        "* Added a summary table of the training statistics (validation loss, time per epoch, etc.).\n",
        "* Added validation loss to the learning curve plot, so we can see if we're overfitting. \n",
        "    * Thank you to [Stas Bekman](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/stasbekman) for contributing this!\n",
        "* Displayed the per-batch MCC as a bar plot.\n",
        "\n",

        "* huggingface renamed their library to `transformers`. \n",
        "* Updated the notebook to use the `transformers` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Version 1** - *July 22nd, 2019*\n",
        "* Initial version."

        "* It might make more sense to use the MCC score for “validation accuracy”, but I’ve left it out so as not to have to explain it earlier in the Notebook.\n",
        "* Seeding -- I’m not convinced that setting the seed values at the beginning of the training loop is actually creating reproducible results…\n",
        "* The MCC score seems to vary substantially across different runs. It would be interesting to run this example a number of times and show the variance.\n"
