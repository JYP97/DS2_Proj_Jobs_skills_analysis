## Brief Description:  
In the modern work world today skills are of increasing importance and outweigh traditional metrics like degrees. Companies these days use skill analysis to:  
+ Identify skills from candidates (e.g. via CVs)
+ Match skills with open positions (internal career development + externals)
+ Identify skill trends (upwards and downwards) and prepare their workforce for the future
