 Hi. My name is Kerry Spry. I'm the President and CEO of bwpcareers.com and I've got an exciting opportunity for motivated professionals from your area that would like to immediately   AVG. $1800-$3000 PER WEEK   in the ""easy to learn, easy to earn"" recruiting business. 
 First things first...I know you've probably seen and heard it all before. You've heard all the empty and broken promises. You've heard all the bait and switch approaches a thousand times. Companies that promise a ""great opportunity"" but want your hard-earned money before you can get started. And by now you're sick of it all. All you want to do is earn a living and an income that affords you the opportunity to enjoy your life and do more for yourself and for your family than just pay bills and get by. I know because I've been there before myself and I know exactly how it feels which is why the first thing I want to do is separate myself and my company by saying, ""this is not any of that at all, not even close"". This is a real contract position and a real job where you can make great money fast and we will never ask for any money for any reason ever!!! So leave your concerns behind and focus on what you're about to read. 
 If you're offered a contract to work with bwpcareers.com, your job would be to work from your home or virtual office to find and hire ""commission only"" sales representatives who live in any one of my clients 84 nationwide sales markets across the US to sell Above Ground Swimming Pools. My client will provide the sales representatives that you hire with 2-3 warm, credit pre-approved, TV and Internet appointments every day and will never ask your hires for a single dime. In addition, they'll never ever be asked to do any cold calling of any kind, no door to door, no telemarketing and they will make very good money!!! Again, my client provides the sales representatives that you're hiring with 100% of their appointments. No cold calling of any kind will ever be required by the sales representatives you're hiring. Furthermore, my client will pay their gas money to run their first 10 appointments. All of that only makes your job as a Virtual Recruiter with bwpcareers.com even easier. 
 About your pay as a Virtual Recruiter...I will pay you $300.00 plus bonuses for every new sales representative who graduates from my clients training class and runs just two appointments. Once they've graduated from training and have run just two appointments you get paid. Again,   AVG. $1800-$3,000 PER WEEK!!!   And if you don't have any recruiting experience at all, that's not a problem. I will teach you what you need to know. But your job as a Virtual Recruiter is giving people a job for a living. It's really that easy!!! 
 Our average recruiter hires 6-10 new sales representatives per week. I also have recruiters who hire 15-20 new sales representatives per week times $300.00 per hire!!! Does that sound like the kind of money you want to be making? 
 Obviously, there's a great deal of money to be made as a Virtual Recruiter here with us at bwpcareers.com. Prove yourself useful and you can have this contract every year for as long as you want it. The client our company serves has been in business for over 30 years and has been my client since 2006!!!

We are known as ""The Rogue IMO"" because we are paying agents what they deserve and making our competitors nervous while doing it.
5 Things that separates Family First Life from the Rest of the Industry
1. Aggressive Compensation + Bonuses  Here at FFL our compensation goes up to 145%.  We will start you out between 100-110%%  FFL pays producer bonuses, agents can earn up to 2% additional commission on their annual production.
2. Exclusive Leads available  Most companies do not offer an exclusive lead program.  Our leads are NEVER resold so you don’t have to worry about competing with your peers.
3. LIVE Regional Training from REAL Top Producers  It can be very difficult to find an IMO that offers sales training to its agents that isn’t limited to online modules. Here at FFL we offer hands on regional training from qualified producers. It doesn’t matter where you live in the U.S. we can provide local support. On top of this there is endless online training videos and interaction between producers. You are independent but not in it alone.
*** All of our trainers issue pay $20,000 MINIMALLY each month, so we can guarantee you’ll be well equipped to quickly learn how to close over 75% of your appointments.
4. Do you know what Vested Renewals are?
If your answer to this question was no than you are probably not being paid renewals. Renewals are residual commission payments that you receive for the life of certain policies you write.
At FFL, these residuals are vested day one meaning if you ever leave FFL you take your renewals with you.
5. No Contract or Fees
FFL is one of the few true independently owned IMO’s in the industry. We are not contracted through another IMO, FFL works directly with several Top Rated Insurance Carriers which allows us to offer the most aggressive compensation in the industry, pay bonuses and give out vested renewals because there is no other entity to share the commission with.
FFL agents are also truly independent, there is no contract for you to sign with FFL.
We pride ourselves on the fact that there are no fees associated in working with FFL. No startup cost, no cost for training or to attend our Sales Conferences. If you are looking for an MLM or Networking Marketing Organization FFL would not be a good fit for you.
